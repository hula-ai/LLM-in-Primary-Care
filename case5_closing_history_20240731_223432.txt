This is what we call plantar fasciitis, really 99.9%, that's what it is, based on your symptoms, based on that intense pain that you experience when you first step out of bed, you know, that gets a little better as you walk on it. So it's basically an inflammation, it's an inflammatory process at the bottom of your foot. And what can we do about it? We can use anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen and naproxen, you can take those by mouth, I will write a prescription for you for high-strength ibuprofen, 800mg, that you can take three times per day with a little bit of food, because I don't want to upset your stomach. Also, I'm going to order a gel, a topical gel, called Voltaren gel, it's the Clofenac, that you can apply 3-4 times per day and massage it in a little bit. Also in the information material that I just gave you, you will find some information about how to do stretching exercises, plantar exercises, if you do those regularly, kind of religiously, those can help a lot too. And so I think that's a good start for right now, some anti-inflammatory medications, if you feel like ice helps you, you can try that, not everybody likes icing the bottom of the foot, but you can try some icing, and then you can try these plantar stretching exercises. Now the only thing that I need you to be aware of, as I briefly mentioned to you earlier, is that these type of problems can be very stubborn, so even if they're not dangerous, I mean it's not dangerous or anything, but it really can be very bothersome, because in fact it could keep you from running this big marathon. But I want to stay positive, let's start with this, and if you really, really don't get better, an option that we have in the future, not right away, is to do an x-ray of your foot, just to make sure that there is nothing else, like a little bone spur, like maybe a little tiny fracture, you know, but that's down the line, just to make sure you don't get better. Okay, is this pretty clear, or do you have any questions for me? You know doctor, this is pretty clear, I just, the thought of not being able to run is kind of messing with my head right now, you know, and I don't know, I just wonder, I've been training for so long, and so hard, and is there any pain medications, strong pain medications that you can give me, so that I can keep running, and finish this marathon, I hear you, I hear that this can be a very long process, and if things don't get better, but I just don't know if I'm ready to give up running just yet. No, in fact I don't want you to give up running, okay, but I said what I said, so that you kind of don't, you keep that in mind, okay, as a possibility, okay, because we need to be realistic, but besides what I just told you, the high dose of ibuprofen, the endocrine spinach gel, the stretching exercises, if in a couple of weeks you really feel like there hasn't been enough change, one thing that we could consider are injections at the bottom of your foot of steroids, steroids again are very strong anti-inflammatories, we could even use those orally, okay, but sometimes we can inject them, and they can be a little bit more effective. Now we don't perform the injections in this particular office, but we do have colleagues and podiatrists, you know, foot specialists who can do that for you, so that would be an option, so definitely I don't want you to think that we're running out of options, because actually we haven't even started with anything, right, so you kind of need to go step by step, but yes, that's the key, it is a step by step process, you know, so we don't want to jump on the moon doing everything together all at once, do you feel comfortable with this plan and what do you think about that? Yeah, I feel comfortable with this plan, if you think the high dosage ibuprofen will work, high dosage ibuprofen, I don't think there's anything stronger that I could potentially get just for the pain, I think I'm comfortable with it. Very good, very good, so I'll see you back in a couple of weeks then, okay, you're given no problem, you come back, you give me a report and then we'll go from there. Thank you. You're welcome, best wishes to you, okay, bye-bye now, bye.
