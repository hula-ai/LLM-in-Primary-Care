Migraines are often on one side, they're very sharp, they're worse with noise and light, they can be worse with stress. There's other conditions like something called a tension headache, which is like a muscular headache. There's also something called a cluster headache. I don't think you have those, your symptoms aren't really consistent with either of those conditions. There's another condition where people get headaches because they're taking medications too frequently. Your medication frequency doesn't sound that bad, so I'm not actually that concerned about that condition. Sometimes when you have headaches associated with taking medications, we have to stop all your medications, but I don't think they're there. I really think it's just migraines. So there's a couple things with migraines. One is I'm going to give you a medication called sumatriptan, which is a medication to get rid of your migraines. When you have it, you take the medication, especially like early on, and when you feel the migraine coming out, you take it and it will get better. And then I think that's where we should start. In addition, I think we need to start a headache diary so that we can look at the frequency of your headaches and if there's specific triggers. For you, I think it's going to be stress and then lack of sleep. Anytime you skip a meal because you're working a lot, all those things can trigger migraines. If you're taking the sumatriptan frequently, I would say like twice a week, then I think we should talk about preventive medications. There's a lot of medications we can give you to prevent migraines from escalating and from you getting them so frequently. The sumatriptan is really a band-aid. You have the headache, you take the sumatriptan, it goes away. But it doesn't actually prevent you from getting migraines in the first place. In the future, we may give you a preventive medication. We could start a therapy. We could do things to help you address your stress. I know that the deadline is coming up. Often with my patients, once your deadline is gone, a lot of these things get better. So that may be the case. But if you feel like you need help with anxiety, depression, we have therapists here who can talk to you about, give you skills to manage those things. I know that you work for SpaceX, and my suspicion is that this isn't going to be the only deadline. You're going to continue to have deadlines come up at a rapid pace. So this may not be the last time that you were in a stressful work situation. So let me pause there and see if you have any questions for me. Is this a headache medication addictive in any way? It's not. Once again, sometimes people can take the sumatriptan. If you took it every day, then it can cause headaches as well. But as long as you're taking it every once in a while, you're fine. And how quickly after taking it should I have a headache go away? Usually it's in minutes to less than an hour at most, which is normal. But it's not addictive the same way that hydrocodone or fentanyl are addictive. With those medications, you take it and then your body physically needs it, and you go through withdrawal. That doesn't happen with this medication. Would this be kind of like a stimulant at all? No. What it does is it narrows your arteries in your brain. So one of the thoughts about migraines is that your blood vessels are dilated, so they're too big. And that causes the pulsation and the pain in your head. So it kind of narrows those blood vessels. So it's a vaso-vaso-vaso-instructor? Yeah. Okay. Any other questions for me? Okay. Well, I hope you feel better. Thank you.
