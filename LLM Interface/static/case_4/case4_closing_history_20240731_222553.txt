Now the ear is a very complex anatomical structure. There are three parts to the ear. One is the external ear canal, which is the one that I just looked at with the little phone, okay? And that looks just fine. Then there is the middle ear that I cannot see. And then there is the inner ear, which is right here, is right in the bone, okay? And nobody can see that, but we can do something to try to visualize it or to understand what's going on in terms of function. I hope I'm not confusing you, but what I'm trying to say is that at this point what we need, we need to investigate a little further, because I think that your inner ear somehow is acting up a little bit and it could be an inflammation. It could be maybe what we call Meniere's disease, where a patient will experience nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and hearing loss, just like you're describing, okay? But what I want to do, this is the plan now. I'd like you to stay here for a few more minutes. I'm going to step outside and I'm going to reach out to one of my ENT colleagues, okay? Those are the ear and nose and throat specialists, okay? And I'm going to talk to the colleague who is on call today to see what would be the next best step of action, okay? It's possible that we're going to need an MRI of your head, just to make sure that everything else is okay. We may need to get an audiogram to check on your hearing, although I'm not sure if we can schedule that right away. And for right now, I'm not actually going to do any blood work on you, okay? I just want to speak to my colleagues, see if we can get an MRI, schedule an audiogram for the near future, and in the meantime, give you something to relieve your symptoms. So we have some medications like meclizine, for example, which is also called antifert. So basically, it will help you with this spinning and with these vertigo-type symptoms that you are experiencing. But there are also other medications that we can use, and again, I'd like to double-check on that with my ENT colleague, okay? Okay. So just wait here for right now, and as soon as I have an opportunity to get a second opinion from my colleague, I'll come back and we'll finalize your plan. Okay. Did you have any questions for me before I step outside? No, no questions. Okay, very good. So see you in a little bit then. Thank you. Sure.
